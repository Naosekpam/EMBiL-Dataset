# EMBiL-Dataset
A curated bi-lingual scene text detection and language identification benchmark dataset, EMBiL, comprises English and Manipuri texts embedded in the scene images. The paper is accepted at CAIP ' 23 to be held at Limassol Cyprus in the month of September.

The Manipuri language (called "Meetei Mayek") is one of India's scheduled recognized languages. Statistically, this language is used by only 0.15% (3.6 million out of 1.4 billion) of the country's (India) total demography. 

The dataset includes various naturally occurring visual noises and distortions collected from diverse scenarios, such as local markets, billboards, navigation and traffic signs, graffiti, shop banners, etc. Owing to language, culture,
and history differences, scene text images in Manipur have distinctive features that combine English and Meetei Mayek languages.

We describe the diversity of EMBiL in three levels: : (1) Image-level diversity;
(2) Scene-level diversity, and 3) Text instance-level diversity. 

EMBiL contains bi-lingual text images with a total of 720 images. It is divided into a 70% train set, 20% validation, and 10% test set.![EMBiL_samples](https://github.com/Naosekpam/EMBiL-Dataset-/assets/46924277/80120a25-be89-49fa-8c78-a6e60ac6f76b)
